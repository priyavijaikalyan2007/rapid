# Conversation record

## 23 October 2026: Instruction and status review

### User request

> Ok. I setup various instructions in this repository. Can you read them back, summarize the instructions and let me know your role in this repository. Also, summarize the status.

The user also supplied the root instruction entry point and writing rules for this workspace.
Those rules require plain language, accurate technical terms, connected reasoning, and restrained formatting.

### Response summary

The instruction entry point routes through WORKFLOW.md, PROJECT_PROFILE.md, PROJECT.md, and ADDITIONAL.md.
The profile assigns Codex all eleven listed roles, from product and planning through implementation and operations.
Codex must use native platform themes, colors, components, and official interaction guidance.
Project facts require local processing, on-device AI, privacy, and no required proprietary external services.
The shared workflow requires planning, tests before implementation, regression checks, documentation, and local commits without a push.

The profile check passed.
Only the native-client component is enabled, and its source scope includes all of src/.
The existing website lacks a separately enabled website component.
ADDITIONAL.md and SETUP.md still contain unfinished setup work.
The root test, run, and package scripts are placeholders.
The root test command exited with status 2 and a configuration TODO.
The existing build.sh routes to component builds, but this review did not run application builds or tests.

CropPrint source, tests, packaging scripts, and App Review materials exist.
Its metadata script reported version 1.0.0, build 18, and source 3b8593a881e1-dirty before this review record.
This metadata does not prove that an archive was built or uploaded.
The website source and deployment scripts exist.
Composure contains three planning documents and no application implementation.
Its plan also references specification filenames that differ from the files present.

At review start, main matched the locally recorded origin/main at 3b8593a.
Tracked files had no changes, but the newly installed instructions and setup files were untracked.
Required agentknowledge files, specs status records, CHANGELOG.md, and this conversation record were absent.
The new root license selects GPL-3.0-or-later, while the CropPrint README states MIT.
Copied instructions retain their MIT notices.
License scope and document consistency need review before further changes rely on them.

Historical memory recorded an unfinished replacement App Store release.
That historical release status may be stale and was not verified against App Store Connect during this review.
The review changed only this conversation record and preserved the user's setup files.
